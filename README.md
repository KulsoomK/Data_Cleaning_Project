# Hotel Booking Data Cleaning Project

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project focuses on cleaning and preparing the **Hotel Booking Demand** dataset for further analysis and modeling.
The dataset contains over **119,000 booking records** from both a **City Hotel** and a **Resort Hotel**, with details such as reservation status, guest demographics, booking channels, and more.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

The main goals of this project are to:

* Identify and handle **missing values**.
* Correct **inconsistent or erroneous entries**.
* Fix **data types** (e.g., dates, categorical values).
* Remove **duplicates**.
* Engineer **useful features** (e.g., total guests, is family trip).
* Export a **clean version** of the dataset for analysis or modeling.

## ðŸ›  Tools & Libraries

* **Python** (3.x)
* **Pandas** and **NumPy** â†’ data cleaning & manipulation
* **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** â†’ quick visual checks
* **Missingno** â†’ visualizing missing data
